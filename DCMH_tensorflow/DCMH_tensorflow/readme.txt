2.We recommend you re-implement DCMH with matconvnet version. (http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/jiangqy/code/DCMH_matlab.zip)
3.We implement DCMH on tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/). Tensorflow version: 1.0.
4.setup: (we use MIRFLICKR-25K dataset as a demo)
    4.0.before you run DCMH tensorflow demo.
    4.1.preprocessing:
        please preprocessing dataset to appropriate input format.
        or you can download dataset from pan.baidu.com
        MIRFLICKR25K:

        For convenience, I divided all varibles into some single files. After download the dataset, pls merge all variables by yourself.
    4.2.put files in correct path :
            ./datafile
            ./data/imagenet-vgg-f.mat
    4.3.run DCMH_demo.py
5.description:
    DCMH_demo.py:           a demo for DCMH algorithm on MIRFLICKR-25K dataset.
    net_structure_img.py    net structure for image modality.
    net_structure_txt.py    net structure for text modality.
